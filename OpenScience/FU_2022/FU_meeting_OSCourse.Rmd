## Background

$~$

* In November 2022, Bob and I were involved in teaching a PhD course on _Open and Reproducible Science_.

\vspace{2mm}

* 2.5 credit points.

\vspace{2mm}

* Taking place in the Alpine center in Finse.

\vspace{2mm}

* Roughly 25 participants.

---

We received very positive feedback from the students.

\begin{quote}

 "I think this course should be continued."
 
 \vspace{2mm}

 "There are many colleagues who love the idea of open science but they feel isolated nad do not have a direction to move ahead. I will recommend this course to them."
 
  \vspace{2mm}

 "I would recommend the course to all PhDs and post-docs at my department/collaborators"
 
 \vspace{2mm}
 
 "I hope that more young researchers can join the course in the future. I think the information and skills after such course can influence significantly someone's career or even change it."
 
  \vspace{2mm}
  
  Our students: "This course should be on offer as a transferable skills course at NTNU!" 

\end{quote}

### Course content

$~$

* Introduction on terminology (open science, reproducibility, transparancy)

\vspace{1mm}

* Data Management Plan (DMP)

\vspace{1mm}

* Data collection and data handling

\vspace{1mm}

* Data repositories

\vspace{1mm}

* FAIR data principles

\vspace{1mm}

* Using version control (git/GitHub)

\vspace{1mm}

* Reproducible work flows / neat coding strategies

\vspace{1mm}

* Best practice in data analysis and reporting results

## Why is this relevant?

A survey carried out by _Nature_ in 2016, sheds light on researcher's experiences and thoughts.

## Open and reproducible research...

$~$

* ...benefits the researcher (easy to track what you did, modify analyses, builds trust in your work, increases citation rates etc).

\vspace{2mm}

* ...benefits the research community (others can build on your data, code and results).

\vspace{2mm}

* ...benefits society (more insight for money, more trustworthy results, more scientific progress).

\vspace{2mm}

* ...are thus _basic skills any researcher in the future will HAVE to master_!

### Other institutions are a step ahead

For example, the Center for Reproducible Science, University of Zurich:

### Our idea

$~$

Given the positive feedback on the mentioned course (and the negative feedback on other TS courses) and the importance of the topic, we wondered:

$~$

 
* Is it possible to set up a transferable skills course at the department/faculty/entire NTNU?
 
 $~$
 
* If yes, what would be the strategy forward?
