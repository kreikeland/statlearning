# Learning outcomes of TMA4268

1. **Knowledge.** The student has knowledge about the most popular statistical learning models and methods that are used for _prediction_ and _inference_ in science and technology. Emphasis is on regression- and classification-type statistical models.

2. **Skills.** The student can, based on an existing data set, choose a suitable statistical model, apply sound statistical methods, and perform the analyses using statistical software. The student can present, interpret and communicate the results from the statistical analyses, and knows which conclusions can be drawn from the analyses, and what the caveats are.

# Who is this course for?

## Primary requirements

$~$

* Bachelor level: 3rd year student from Science or Technology programs, and master/PhD level students with interest in performing statistical analyses.

\vspace{2mm}

* Statistics background: TMA4240/45 Statistics, ST1101+ST1201 (probability theory and statistical methods), or equivalent.

\vspace{2mm}

* No background in statistical software needed: but we will use the R statistical software extensively in the course. Knowing python will make this easier for you!

\vspace{2mm}

* Advangatge with knowledge of computing - for example an introductory course in informatics, like TDT4105 or TDT4110.

---

## Overlap
\vspace{2mm}

* [TDT4173](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TDT4173#tab=omEmnet) Machine learning and case based reasoning: courses differ in philosophy (computer science vs. statistics).

\vspace{2mm}

* [TMA4267](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TMA4267#tab=omEmnet) Linear Statistical Models: useful to know about multivariate random vectors, covariance matrices and the multivariate normal distribution. Overlap only for multiple linear regression (M3).

---


# About the course

## Focus: Statistical theory **and** doing analyses

$~$

* The course has focus on **statistical theory**, but we apply all models and theory using (mostly) available function in R and real data sets. 

\vspace{2mm}

* It is important that the student in the end of the course **can analyse all types of data** (covered in the course) - not just understand the theory. 

\vspace{2mm}

* And vice versa - the student must also **understand** the model, methods and algorithms used. 


---

## Teaching philosophy


&nbsp;  

* Divide the topics of the course into modular units with specific focus.

&nbsp;   

* This (hopefully) facilitates learning?
 
&nbsp;   

* Two weeks without lectures, time to work on the compulsory exercises.  

---

## Learning methods, activities and grading
$~$

* Lectures, exercises and works (projects). 

&nbsp;  


* Portfolio assessment is the basis for the grade awarded in the course. This portfolio comprises 
    + a written **final (school!) examination (80%)**.
    + two projects / compulsory exercises ($2\times 10\%=20\%$). 
    
&nbsp;  

* The results for the constituent parts are to be given in %-points, while the grade for the whole portfolio (course grade) is given by the letter grading system. Retake of examination may be given as an oral examination. The lectures are given in English.






---

## The lectures 

\vspace{2mm}  

**Mondays at 14.15-16.00 in S3 and Thursdays at 08.15-10.00 in S2**

\vspace{2mm}

* We have $2\times 2$ hours of lectures every week (except when working with the compulsory exercises).

\vspace{2mm}

* See here [https://github.com/stefaniemuff/statlearning/blob/master/TMA4268_schedule2022.pdf](https://github.com/stefaniemuff/statlearning/blob/master/TMA4268_schedule2022.pdf) for a tentative schedule.

\vspace{2mm}

* **I suggest that you always have your laptop handy for the lecture.** So you can run code or do an exercise in class. 


---

### The first week: The R course

$~$

* In this **first week of the course** you will have to work through parts 1-6 of the R course on the openEdX page here: [https://digit.ntnu.no/courses/course-v1:NTNU+IMF001+2020/course/](https://digit.ntnu.no/courses/course-v1:NTNU+IMF001+2020/course/)

$~$

* Log in with your Feide account (scroll a bit down).

$~$

* There is a discussion forum that you can use for the R course.

## Recommended exercises

\vspace{2mm}

* For each module *recommended exercises* are uploaded. These are partly 
    * theoretical exercises (from book or not)
    * computational tasks
    * data analysis

\vspace{2mm}

* These are supervised in the weekly exercise slots. 

\vspace{2mm}

* Solutions will be provided to check yourself (no grading).

$~$

Currently there are **three slots** in the schedule:

* Mon 8:15-10:00 (F2)
* Wed 12:15-14:00 (F6)
* Wed 14:15-16:00 (S4)

\vspace{2mm}

But **do we need all of those**? (todo: zoom poll)

\vspace{2mm}

* We of course have to start with online supervision. How this works will be communicated (see also course website).

---

## The compulsory exercises

\vspace{4mm}

* We will have **two compulsory exercises**, each with a maximal score of 50 points.

\vspace{2mm}

* These are supervised in the weekly exercise slots and there will be one week without lectures (only with supervision) for each compulsory exercise.

\vspace{2mm}

* Focus: theory, analysis in R, and interpretation.

\vspace{2mm}

* Work in **groups of maximum 3**; handed in on Blackboard and be written in R Markdown (both .Rmd and .pdf handed in).

\vspace{2mm}

* The TAs grade the exercises.

\vspace{2mm}

* The compulsory exercises sum up to 20% of the final evaluation in the course, the written exam the remaining 80%.


---

* The **\textcolor{red}{first compulsory exercise}** will be held after Modules 1-5. 
  
  \hspace{8mm} Suggested submission deadline:  
  \vspace{2mm}
  \hspace{8mm} **Monday, 21. Februar 2022, 23:59h**.

## Learning material for this module

$~$

_\textcolor{red}{Required}_:

\vspace{1mm}

* Our textbook James et al (2013): An Introduction to Statistical Learning - with Applications in R (ISL). 
  + Chapter 1 (Introduction)
  + 2.3 (Lab: Introduction to R)

\vspace{2mm}

* Go through parts 1 to 6 in the online R course: https://digit.ntnu.no/courses/course-v1:NTNU+IMF001+2020/course/

Use your Feide account.

\vspace{3mm}

_\textcolor{red}{Recommended}_:

\vspace{1mm}

* Watch the video lecture for Chapter 1 by Hastie and Tibshirani [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/).



* Background on Matrix Algebra: [Härdle and Simes (2015) - Chapter 2: A short excursion into Matrix Algebra](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-45171-7_2) (on the reading list for TMA4267 Linear statistical models). 


<!-- ## Added after the lecture -->

# What is statistical learning?

* Refers to _a vast set of tools to understanding data_ (text book, p. 1). 

\vspace{1mm}

* Main distinction: _\textcolor{red}{Supervised}_ versus _\textcolor{red}{unsupervised learning}_.

\vspace{1mm}

<!-- * The ``chain'' of statistical learning:  -->

<!-- model $\rightarrow$ method $\rightarrow$ algorithm $\rightarrow$ analysis $\rightarrow$ interpretation -->

* Both **prediction** and **inference** (understanding $\rightarrow$ drawing conclusions). 

\vspace{1mm}

* Statistical learning is **a statistical discipline**, but the boarders are becoming more blurred.


---

# Statistical Learning vs. ``Machine Learning'' 

\vspace{2mm}

* Machine learning is more focused on the algorithmic part of learning, and is a _discipline in computer science_. 

\vspace{2mm}

* But many methods/algorithms are common to both fields.


---

# Statistical Learning vs. ``Data Science''

Data science

* Aim: to extract knowledge and understanding from data.
\vspace{2mm}

* Requires a combination of statistics, mathematics, numerics, computer science and informatics. 

This encompasses the whole process of 
 
 1. data acquisition/scraping
 2. going from unstructured to structured data
 3. setting up a data model
 4. implementing and performing data analysis
 5. interpreting and communicating results 

In statistical learning we will not work on the two first above (acquisition and unstructured to structured).


[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is an excellent read and relevant for this course!

---

# Problems you will learn to solve


There are **three main types of problems** discussed in this course:

* Regression (supervised)

* Classification (supervised)

* Unsupervised methods

using data from science, technology, industry, economy/finance, ...

---

# Example 1: Regression (Etiology of CVD)

* The Framingham Heart Study investigates the underlying causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (see <https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/>). 
<!--(In Norway we have the Health survey of Nord-Trondelag, HUNT - but not with data available for teaching.)-->

* Aim: modelling systolic blood pressure (\texttt{SYSBP}) using data from $n=2600$ persons. 

* For each person in the data set we have measurements of the following seven variables.

\scriptsize

* `SYSBP` systolic blood pressure (mmHg),
* `SEX` 1=male, 2=female,
* `AGE` age (years), 
* `CURSMOKE` current cigarette smoking at examination: 0=not current smoker, 1= current smoker,
* `BMI` body mass index,
* `TOTCHOL` serum total cholesterol (mg/dl),
* `BPMEDS` use of anti-hypertensive medication at examination: 0=not currently using, 1=currently using.
\normalsize

```

What does this plot show?

Red: male; turquoise: female

---

* Diagonal: density plot (generalization of histogram), or barplot.
* Lower diagonals: scatterplot, histograms
* Upper diagonals: correlations, boxplots or barplots

\vspace{2mm}

We use `sex` to color the graph.


---

### Etiology of CVD

\vspace{3mm}

The question: 
**What are the factors that cause high SBP?**

\vspace{2mm}

$\rightarrow$ we are interested in _inference_ (explanation), not prediction!


\vspace{4mm}

* A _multiple normal linear regression model_ was fit to the data set with 
$$-\frac{1}{\sqrt{\texttt{SYSBP}}}$$ 
as response (output) and all the other variables as covariates (inputs). 

\vspace{2mm}

* The results are used to formulate hypotheses about the etiology of CVD - to be studied in new trials.

---

\scriptsize
```{r CVDanalyse, eval=TRUE,include=TRUE,message=FALSE,results="hold"}

```

# Example 2: Classification (iris plants)

The `iris` flower data set is a very famous multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. 

$~$

The data set contains

* **three plant species** \{setosa, virginica, versicolor\} 
* **four features measured** for each corresponding sample:
  + `Sepal.Length`
  + `Sepal.Width`
  + `Petal.Length`
  + `Petal.Width`.

---

\scriptsize
```{r iris, include=TRUE}
head(iris)
```
\normalsize

---

Aim: correctly classify the species of an iris plant from sepal length and sepal width.

```{r iriscont, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
ggpairs(iris, aes(colour=Species), title="Classification of Iris plants")
# irisplot = ggplot(data=iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) 
# irisplot = irisplot + geom_point(aes(color=Species)) 
# irisplot = irisplot + xlab("Sepal Length") + ylab("Sepal Width")
# irisplot = irisplot + ggtitle("Classification of Iris plants")
# irisplot
```

---

## Linear boundaries

\vspace{2mm}

In this plot the small black dots represent correctly classified iris plants, while the red dots represent misclassifications. The big black dots represent the class means.

&nbsp;  
  

```{r irislda, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5,out.width="10cm"}
library(klaR)
drawparti(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,  prec=301, gs=20,  method="lda", image.colors=c("#F8766D", "#00BA38", "#619CFF"), xlab="Sepal Length", ylab="Sepal Width", print.err=0)

```


---

## Non-linear boundaries

\vspace{2mm}

Sometimes a non-linear boundary is more suitable. 
&nbsp;  
  
```{r irisqda,  echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5,out.width="10cm"}
drawparti(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, prec=301, gs=20,  method="qda", image.colors=c("#F8766D", "#00BA38", "#619CFF"), print.err=0, xlab="Sepal Length", ylab="Sepal Width")
legend("topright", legend=c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"),title="Species", fill=c("#F8766D", "#00BA38", "#619CFF"),  inset=.02 , cex=0.8)

```

---

# Example 3: Unsupervised methods (Gene expression)

\vspace{2mm}

* The relationship between inborn maximal oxygen uptake and skeletal muscle gene expression was studied. 

\vspace{1mm}

* Rats were artificially selected for high- and low running capacity (HCR and LCR, respectively).

\vspace{1mm}

* Rats were either kept seditary or trained. 

\vspace{1mm}

* Transcripts significantly related to running capacity and training were identified.
<!--  (moderated t-tests from two-way anova models, false discovery rate controlled).  -->

\vspace{1mm}

* Heat maps showing the expression level for the most significant transcripts were presented graphically.

\vspace{1mm}

* This is _hierarchical cluster analysis_ with pearson correlation distance measure (module 10).


---

```{r heatmap_pic, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Heat map of the most significant transcripts. Transcripts with a high expression are shown in red and transcripts with a low expression are shown in yellow.", out.width = '150pt'}
knitr::include_graphics("heatmap.png")
